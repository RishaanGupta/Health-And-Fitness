      Good health can be obtained by doing workouts and by getting fit!!
      Good Health doesen't mean that if there's nothing wrong with you then u are at good health.
      Good Health means that you are at the best u can be. Good Health also includes your brain.

      So all this boringness aside all u need to know is:
      Good Health = Good life! Need I say anything else? That's what I thought!
